# raspberry-pi-hole
Documentation for setting up a Raspberry Pi-Hole.

I found a Raspberry Pi 2B, somewhat forgotten and bashed about, under my bed. I've been itching to get started learning some networking and Linux skills, so here goes.

Hardware:

-Raspberry Pi 2B
-Power Supply
-Ethernet Cable
-Micro SD Card (32GB)*


*Smaller would be sufficient, but that's what I had.
